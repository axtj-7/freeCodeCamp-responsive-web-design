        <h1>Core Computer Science</h1>
        <p>Core computer science introduces the study of computation, focusing on algorithms, data structures, programming, and systems like Operating Systems (OS), Databases (DBMS), and Networks (CN), to build efficient software and hardware, solve problems using logical steps (imperative knowledge), and understand how computers process information from basic logic to AI. It's the foundation for understanding modern tech, combining math, logic, and engineering to create solutions across various fields.</p>

            <h2>Data Structures and Algorithm</h2>
            <p>Data structures and algorithms (DSA) are the foundational concepts of computer science focused on efficiently organizing data and solving computational problems. They are essential for developing high-quality software and are a primary focus in technical interviews at major tech companies.</p>

            <h2>Database Management System</h2>
            <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that manages databases, acting as an interface between users/applications and the organized data, allowing for efficient creation, storage, retrieval, and updating while ensuring security, integrity, and controlled access, solving issues like data redundancy and inconsistency found in older file systems. It provides tools for defining structure, manipulating data (querying/editing), and managing the system, with examples including MySQL (relational) and MongoDB (NoSQL).</p>

            <h2>Object Orienteed Programming</h2>
            <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a coding paradigm using "objects" (data + functions) to model real-world things, making software modular, reusable, and easier to manage, built on core principles like Classes (blueprints), Objects (instances), Encapsulation (bundling), Inheritance (reusing), Abstraction (hiding complexity), and Polymorphism (flexibility). It structures programs around interacting objects, simplifying complex systems for better maintenance and scalability, fundamental to languages like Python, Java, C++.</p>
